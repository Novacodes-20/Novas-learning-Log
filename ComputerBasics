Helo Guys- 
# when thinking about computers what we know is External hardware components like monitor,mouse,cpu and yes you're right 
but there's actually a lot more than that BTS(behind the scene) of what u have thought of and in this section we will 
explore some of them in detail.
  Major things to consider to learn about Computers are:
 1.Hardware
 2.Software
 3.Firmware
Lets first dive what's hardware and how does this actually works-
  As you may be familiar with CPU AND external devices like mouse,keyboard monitior,etc all these comes under hardware.
  Understand this as a Human body-
  Nervous system-MotherBoard
  Brain-cpu(Cental processing unit)/Processors 
  short term memory-RAM(Random access memory)also called Volatile
  Long term memory-HDD/SSD(Hard disk or solid state drive)called as Non volatle
will ce what is volatile or non volatile but before first lets understand how each things work.

Motherboard:
# Motherboard is a printed circuit board where Cpu is placed inside which acts as a brain for every pc and laptops that we
use nowadys,also processors which is a harware chip which contains multiple cores of CPU so called as Multi-core processors basically contains
4 CPUs(Quad-core).The core that acutally performs compuatation and instruction execution.
# When u see in any laptop there will be a stiker near keypad and that is non other than processors company name and if u 
knew, then Congrats!.
CPU:
  Basic funtions of CPUs are- 
  *ALU(Arthmetic Logic unit) - Performs calculations and logic comparison
  *CU(Contol unit) - directs the operation like a Manger
  *Registers - Small, Super-fast memory locations like scartcpad.
Simple Analogy

Imagine a chef in a kitchen 🍳:
->The recipe book = Memory (RAM)
->The chef = CPU
->The chef reads a recipe (fetches)
->Understands the steps (decodes)
->Cooks the dish (executes)
->Then moves on to the next recipe.

RAM is very well known by u gys,yes its a short term memory location does not store your OS or files permanently.
HDD/SSD - Its the main storage component which stores your data permanently even when you shutdown,amazingly it stores 2 Terabytes of storages
which is more sufficient for normal uses like me.

Software:
# When comes to software its what u see on a virtual screen may be OS(Operating system), apps or files.
And whats the third category?? yas Firmware and whats so special about that is it connects both hardware and software like a bridge, well 
will see that in coming section.

Firmware:
# As I mentioned ealrier it acts as a bypass between hardware and software but HOW? 
# when u switch on a pc basicaslly u first switch the CPU but before there is simple concept called bootloader ->BIOS/UEFI
BIOS(Both input-output system)-An old bootloader which comes into play when u swicth on the pc, the firmware checks the environment of the 
hardware is Good and after completing POST(post operating system test) it tells the driver to bootload or in ur terms loads the computers 
interface or OS.
